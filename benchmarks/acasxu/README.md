These is the acasxu benchmark category. The folder contains .onnx and .vnnlib files used for the category. The acasxu_instances.csv containts the full list of benchmark instances, one per line: onnx_file,vnn_lib_file,timeout_secs
 
This benchmark uses the ACAS Xu networks (from "Reluplex: An efficient SMT solver for verifying deep neural networks"), properties 1-4 run on all networks.

The .vnnlib and .csv files were created with the included generate.py script.
